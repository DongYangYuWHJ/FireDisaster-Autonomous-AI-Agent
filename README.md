# FireDisaster-Autonomous-AI-Agent

This project trains a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) autonomous AI agent to optimize fire suppression strategies in a simulated wildfire environment. The system models fire spread dynamics using cellular automata mechanics, incorporating environmental factors like humidity. The AI agent learns to navigate the environment and efficiently extinguish fires. This approach could be applied to robotics and embedded systems for real-world autonomous firefighting solutions in the future.
